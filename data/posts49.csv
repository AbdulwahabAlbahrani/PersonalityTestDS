1662427,INFP,Lol thats basically the opposite of me  I always talk about the world as I Im looking at it from outside without inserting anything personal I talk mainly in observation and then people are like and ur ok with that And Im like what do you mean thats just how it is How can you have an emotional response to facts Or they get mad at me for defending the motivations of someone they think is bad like hitler when Im just trying to explain how they acted on self-interest And Im always focused on one thing but very focused on it Im very all in on whatever I do so I have a hard time keeping multiple hobbies I want to learn everything about what it is Im  doing and filter out everything else ,mbti,INFP

1662431,INTJ,I struggle when I am deep in thought about a subject and have several paths to achieve one outcome Sometimes I need someone to tell me the best path  Asking is difficult as I cant seem to say how can I do B from A without getting all the different combinations of paths mixed up ,intj,INTJ
1662432,INTJ,Oh gosh You read that clusterfuck of words I wrote while walking I just now realized how confusing it can sound Lmao Anyway youre very welcome I used to be a server so I have a pretty good idea of what people in the back go through Just remember its better to get the orders right the first time so dont feel pressured to rush Your coworkers should be able to pickup your slack until you get the hang of it But try not to be a burden for too long  PEdit: Oops Youre not OP My bad But hopefully you can relate to this ,intj,INTJ
1662433,ISTP,When I take it it usually says that Im primarily ESTP but possibly ENTP or ISTP Ill take in a minute and post the results Here are my results:extraverted Sensing  I get Ti Se/Ni Te Fe Ne Fi Si which is pretty much exactly how I think it should be Interestingly my temperament is Theorist and secondarily Improviser which I also identify with ,mbti,ISTP
1662434,ENTP,Im curious as to why you care to entertain those who dont like the true you anyway Well I do understand it My best friend an INTJ thinks the same way Id ask the same of him though Arent the closer relationships more meaningful and substantial anyway If you lose some people on the way to finding those few who cares You dont need their affection or attention Just be you Youd probably get bored or lose respect anyway of those who are bored of you ,intj,ENTP
1662435,ENTJ♂,i think i know what youre talking about you have this need when someone has a problem and you see you can help you get this irresistible urge to help i used to have that what im asking is after they dont listen and screw their lives up properly can you disengage and not remain disappointed and upset for a long time ,entj,ENTJ

1662437,INTJ,The INTJ way of weight loss is to learn all the relevant details and then use them to execute the plan Those details are freely available all over the web Do not follow fad diets: look up bodybuilding Bodybuilders go through periods of cutting where they shed the fat that they necessarily have to put on when maximising the creation of muscle What duvagin said: you have to change your eating habits radically and permanently You cant go on a diet and then return to your old habits One last piece of advice: diet is paramount and you can have greatest success by primarily focusing on what *NOT* to eat ,intj,INTJ
1662438,ENFP,My Ti is now strong af after hanging with my Ti friends all the time Learned how to talk Ti with them to cue less arguments Although it is only conscious Not subscious like my regular functions Te is still there smacking my buttcheeks to edge me towards telling my brother to stop leaving his skin-graphs on the bathroom wall Same with his love for sprinkling with his tinkling on the toilet seat Anyways Still an ENFP Just a little bit more matured ,mbti,ENFP
1662439,INTJ,Not sure where the Ti is This reads a lot like me ,mbti,INTJ
1662440,ENTJ♀,Aw honey Im sorry you chose a thread topic so excruciatingly ridiculous that attacking the love lives of strangers feels like your best face-saving option now that youve been called out Im sorry but the topic of enduring feelings for my exes is not a big enough smoke bomb for this misguided thread to disappear behind and besides when I reach the aw honey point of condescension in internet arguing the point of meaningful exchange is long past ,entj,ENTJ
1662441,INTP,Yeah can confirm I have good social skills  but it took years of practice At one point in my life I was so quiet shy and anxious around strangers that my parents were certain I was going to grow up to be a monk ,INTP,INTP
1662442,Overly Attached ENTP,We are actually very good at structuring things :) ,entp,ENTP

1662446,"37/f, INFJ, HSP",I work in an open office and I HATE it I can hear 50 conversations at once I can see what everyone is doing there is zero privacy ,introvert,INFJ
1662447,INTJ, when I smoke before  a workout I can feel my movements better Yes this is the same with me I dont smoke before my workouts during the week since I go right before work But on the weekends always Its just another nice release ,intj,INTJ
1662448,INTJ,I agree with unqy Your type is what it is and you cant change it Every type has things they are good and bad at and has the ability the grow and become a better more integrated person I would suggest that this person is fucking over your community college by wasting everyones precious time and money ,mbti,INTJ
1662449,INFJ-34-M,i was always really uncomfortable pretending to be outgoing and more and more as the years have gone by i just stopped pretending now im just myself in whatever situation: reserved quiet i have easily had more honest and meaningful conversations with people since i just started being myself dont hide away from people though make yourself available send smoke signals to people you like be nice and helpful and understanding and charming no need to be hyper animated ,infj,INFJ
